## Dining Experience

1.  **The Menu of Maybe:** Browse a menu that is vaguely suggestive of food, but offers no concrete information about what you might actually receive. Embrace the mystery! üìú
2.  **The Order of Odds:** Place your order with a waiter who may or may not understand your request. Your food may arrive promptly, hours later, or never at all. Patience is a virtue...or a fool's errand. üó£Ô∏è
3.  **The Plate of Possibilities:** Receive your meal, which may be a culinary masterpiece, a plate of garbage, or something that defies categorization altogether. Bon app√©tit...or bon voyage! üçΩÔ∏è
4.  **The Check of Chance:** Attempt to pay your bill, but the prices are determined by a random number generator. You may end up paying next to nothing, or owing a small fortune. Good luck! üí∏

## Possible Menu Items (but not guaranteed):
