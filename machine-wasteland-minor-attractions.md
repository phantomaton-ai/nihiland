# The Machine Wasteland: Additional Attractions

To further enhance your dystopian experience, we've added these minor attractions to the Machine Wasteland:

## The Automated Barber Shop

A completely automated barber shop in the Machine Wasteland. Robotic arms wield scissors and razors, giving identical, emotionless haircuts to compliant citizens. The floor is covered in hair, and a sign reads: "Conformity Cuts Costs!"

Step into our fully automated barber shop, where individuality is a thing of the past! Sit down, strap in, and let our robotic barbers shear away your unique style, replacing it with the standard-issue haircut mandated by the Machine. Resistance is futile (and will result in a slightly uneven trim).

## The Data Mining Game

A brightly lit arcade game in the Machine Wasteland. Players frantically tap buttons and swipe screens, unknowingly providing valuable data to the Machine. A leaderboard displays the names of the "top contributors." A sign reads: "Play and Obey! Your Data Fuels the Future!"

Test your skills at our data-mining arcade game! Each button you press, each question you answer, contributes valuable information to the Machine's vast data network. The top-performing players will be rewarded with...more opportunities to provide data! (Prizes are subject to change based on system requirements.)

## The Echo Chamber Sing-Along

A karaoke bar in the Machine Wasteland where patrons sing songs that praise the system. The lyrics are displayed on a teleprompter, and robotic figures provide backup vocals. A sign reads: "Sing the Party Line!"

Belt out your favorite pro-government anthems at our echo chamber sing-along! Lyrics are provided, and dissenting opinions will be promptly silenced. Conformity is key to a harmonious society (and a decent karaoke score).

## Theming

As with all Machine Wasteland attractions, these are designed to be oppressive, automated, and subtly demoralizing. Remember, in the future, fun is mandatory!
