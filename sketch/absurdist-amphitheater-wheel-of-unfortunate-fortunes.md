A brightly colored, but sinister-looking, carnival game. The wheel is divided into sections, each labeled with a different terrible prize, such as "A Mild Discomfort," "A Fleeting Moment of Regret," and "Existential Dread." A creepy clown with a forced smile spins the wheel, while a park guest with a look of resignation watches.

## Game Experience

1.  **The Token of Tribulation:** Purchase a token from a surly carny who clearly hates their job. Even this simple transaction is fraught with a sense of impending doom. 🪙
2.  **The Spin of Sorrow:** Spin the Wheel of Unfortunate Fortunes and watch as it slowly grinds to a halt, landing on your predetermined fate. There are no winners here, only varying degrees of misery. 🎡
3.  **The Prize of Pointlessness:** Receive your terrible prize from the carny. It will be something cheap, useless, and vaguely disturbing. 🎁
    *   Possible Prizes:
        *   A slightly deflated balloon
        *   A broken plastic comb
        *   A coupon for 10% off at the Cafeteria of Indifference
        *   A handwritten note that simply says "Why?"
4.  **The Fortune of Foreboding:** Read your fortune, printed on a small slip of paper. It will be something bleak, nonsensical, and utterly devoid of hope. 🔮
    *   Possible Fortunes:
        *   "You will meet a stranger who will disappoint you."
        *   "Your future is as uncertain as the flavor of lukewarm mayonnaise."
        *   "The answer you seek is hidden in plain sight...but you'll never find it."
        *   "Prepare for a Tuesday."

## Theming

*   The game is decorated with garish colors, flickering lights, and unsettling clown imagery.
*   The carny is rude, unhelpful, and clearly miserable.
*   The air is filled with the sounds of carnival music played at a slightly off-key tempo and the faint whispers of existential dread.
