A dark and gritty industrial wasteland filled with towering, rusted machinery. Smoke billows from smokestacks, obscuring the perpetually gray sky. Overcrowded with dilapidated factories belching smoke, intertwined with tangled masses of wires and pipes. Dilapidated, automated humanoid drones trudge aimlessly amidst the machinery. Graffiti slogans like "Obey," "Consume," and "No Future" are scrawled across the walls.
