# Le Vide - A Culinary Experience of Meaninglessness

Le Vide is French for "The Void". Enjoy our take on classic (yet underwhelming) cafeteria food at our fine establishment.

## Le Menu

### Le Gray Stew - $49.99

Deconstructed. A murky concoction of unidentifiable vegetables and meat-like protein, simmered in a flavorless broth. Served alongside flavorless crostini.

### Le Beige Burger - $59.99

A patty made from processed soy and served on a locally sourced, artisanally stale bun. Topped with organic, but wilted, lettuce leaf and a slice of heirloom, but flavorless, tomato.

### Le Colorless Chicken - $69.99

A sustainably sourced chicken breast that has been stripped of all its natural flavor and color and is served with non-GMO mashed potatoes (prepared from instant flakes).

### L'Apathetic Pasta - $49.99

Artisanal, locally sourced, hand-rolled pasta tossed in a bland marinara sauce, served with a side of indifference.

### Le Lifeless Salad - $29.99

A deconstructed salad of iceberg lettuce with a few slices of cucumber and tomato. Served with a choice of watery ranch or vinaigrette dressing.

### Le Listless Fries - $19.99

Soggy french fries that have been infused with the essence of apathy and then left sitting under a heat lamp for hours.

### Le Meaningless Mashed Potatoes - $29.99
Artisanal mashed potatoes created from instant flakes and with a hint of artificial butter flavoring.

### Le Disappointing Donut - $9.99

A stale donut with a transparent layer of artificial frosting.
## Le Flavorless Fruit Cup - $19.99

A canned fruit medley, swimming in a sugary syrup that is said to be made from concentrate.

### Les Boissons

*   L'eau du Robinet (Warm tap water)
*   Soda (Flat)
*   Juice (Vaguely fruity)

## Notes:

"Food is fuel. Fuel is necessary for survival. Survival is… debatable." But the portions here aren't even enough fuel to sustain a gnat.

Le Vide is not responsible for any feelings of disappointment, boredom, or existential dread that may result from consuming its food. Eat at your own risk! Bon appétit.
