An aggressive carnival game with several "mole" holes. However, instead of moles, downtrodden members of society dressed in rags, and looking sad, pop up out of the holes. A government worker is swinging the mallet, and looks completely without remorse.

6. Most players score negative points.

## Rules

1. You MUST keep playing until the game turns off.

2. You WILL feel terrible about what you have done.
