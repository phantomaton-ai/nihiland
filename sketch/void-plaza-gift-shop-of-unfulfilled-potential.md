A sparsely stocked gift shop in The Void Plaza. The shelves are lined with items that represent unrealized dreams and missed opportunities: Participation trophies, half-finished paintings, diplomas from uncompleted degree programs, and musical instruments that have never been played. The employees look bored and disinterested. A sign reads: "Remember What Could Have Been...But Isn't."

## Souvenirs of Sadness

*   **The Participation Trophy:** A tarnished trophy awarded for simply showing up. A reminder that you're not a winner, just a participant. 🏆
*   **The Half-Finished Painting:** A blank canvas with a few brushstrokes of color. Representing the artistic masterpiece you never created. 🎨
*   **The Unplayed Instrument:** A dusty guitar or violin that has never been played. A symbol of the musical talent you never developed. 🎻
*   **The Unread Book:** A thick novel that you always intended to read, but never got around to. A reminder of your intellectual laziness. 📚
*   **The Unsent Letter:** A handwritten letter that you never had the courage to send. A testament to your fear of rejection. ✉️
*   **The Expired Gym Membership Card:** A laminated card representing your abandoned fitness goals. A reminder that you'll never be in peak physical condition. 🏋️‍♀️
*   **The Diploma from an Unfinished Degree Program:** A testament to your lack of commitment and follow-through. 🎓

## Theming

*   The gift shop is designed to be depressing, uninspiring, and sparsely stocked.
*   The employees are jaded and unhelpful.
*   The air is filled with the sounds of mournful elevator music and the quiet sighs of disappointed shoppers.
