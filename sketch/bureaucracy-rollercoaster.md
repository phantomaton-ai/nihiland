## The Ride

* First, riders must fill out form 28B-VI, in triplicate, to qualify for entry to the queue. 
* Riders then wait in a queue for a duration randomly between 30 minutes and 3 hours.
* Before boarding the ride, riders must sign a waiver acknowledging that The Bureaucracy Rollercoaster provides no thrills, no excitement, and no point.
* During the ride, the car is occasionally stopped for "random inspections," during which all riders must present identification or be ejected from the ride.
* The ride features no big drops or loops, but contains frequent sudden stops and starts.
* The ride eventually returns to the starting point, where riders are presented with a second form (34D-XIV) and informed they may begin the process again.

## Theming

The ride is located both indoors and outdoors, traveling between and inside a towering government office building. Muzak plays at all times, and government employees can be seen doing paperwork at their desks.

## Safety Warning

This ride may cause anxiety, boredom, and a general sense of futility.
