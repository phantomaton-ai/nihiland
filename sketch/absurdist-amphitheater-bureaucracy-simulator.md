A sprawling, chaotic office space with endless rows of desks piled high with paperwork. Employees with blank expressions stamp documents, file forms, and engage in pointless conversations. A sign hangs overhead: "Welcome to The Bureaucracy Simulator: Your paperwork is our purpose."

## Attraction Experience

1.  **The Application of Agony:** Begin your journey by filling out a multi-page application form that requires nonsensical information and impossible-to-obtain documentation. Make sure to use the correct ink color! 📝
2.  **The Line of Lament:** Wait in a seemingly endless line, shuffling slowly forward as you are bombarded with Muzak and recorded announcements about irrelevant regulations. Hope is a dangerous illusion. 🚶‍♀️
3.  **The Desk of Despair:** Present your application to a bored and indifferent official who will scrutinize it with a magnifying glass and find some minor error. Prepare to start the process all over again! 🧑‍💼
4.  **The Stamp of Stagnation:** If you manage to overcome the first hurdle, you'll receive a stamp on your application...which means absolutely nothing. It's just a stamp! 🖃
5.  **The Filing of Futility:** File your application in a filing cabinet that is overflowing with thousands of identical forms. Your document will be lost forever in a sea of bureaucratic indifference. 🗄️
6.  **The Cycle of Suffering:** Repeat steps 1-5 as many times as you can endure. There is no end, no reward, and no meaning to any of it. Welcome to The Bureaucracy Simulator! ♾️

## Optional Add-ons:

*   **The Red Tape Gauntlet:** Navigate a maze of red tape while avoiding laser sensors and angry government drones. \$19.99
*   **The "Lost Document" Recovery Service:** Pay a premium to have a team of investigators search for your lost application. Success is not guaranteed. \$49.99
*   **The "Expedited Processing" Fee:** Bribe an official to fast-track your application. However, your application will be denied anyway... just faster! \$99.99

## Theming

*   The attraction is designed to be confusing, frustrating, and soul-crushingly boring.
*   The employees are apathetic and unhelpful.
*   The air is filled with the sounds of Muzak, buzzing fluorescent lights, and the rustling of paperwork.

**Disclaimer:** "The Bureaucracy Simulator" may cause feelings of frustration, boredom, and a deep-seated distrust of authority. Not recommended for those with low tolerance for red tape. Prepare for paperwork!
