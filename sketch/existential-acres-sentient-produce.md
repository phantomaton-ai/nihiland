# Existential Acres: The Stand of Sentient Produce 🍎

Dare to question your dietary choices at "The Stand of Sentient Produce," a disturbingly ethical (or unethical?) dining experience in Existential Acres. Here, you'll confront the unnerving possibility that the fruits and vegetables you're about to consume possess consciousness... and perhaps, even a desire to live! 😬

A brightly colored, but unsettling, fruit and vegetable stand. The produce has been given crudely drawn faces, and some of the items appear to be "crying" or "pleading" with their eyes. An employee with a blank stare stands behind the counter, holding a knife. A sign reads: "Are you *sure* you want to eat this?".

## Dining Experience

1.  **The Queue of Moral Quandaries:** As you wait in line, read a series of thought-provoking questions displayed on a chalkboard: "Do plants have feelings?", "Is it ethical to eat sentient beings?", "Are you a murderer?". Prepare to question your entire value system. ✍️
2.  **The Selection Process of Suffering:** Browse a selection of fruits and vegetables, each with crudely drawn faces and expressive eyes. Some items may even "speak" to you (via hidden speakers), begging for their lives. Choose wisely...or not at all! 👀
3.  **The Preparation Station of Pondering:** Watch as a park employee prepares your chosen produce, adding sound effects of pained gurgles and whimpers as they chop, slice, and dice. Contemplate the meaning of suffering. 🔪
4.  **The Consumption Zone of Contrition:** Eat your sentient snack and grapple with the guilt and moral implications of your actions. Did you just commit a terrible crime? Or is it all just a game? 🤔

## Menu

*   **The Screaming Carrot Sticks:** Fresh carrot sticks that emit a high-pitched squeal when bitten. (Vegan option!) 🥕
*   **The Pleading Peach Pie:** A slice of warm peach pie with a peach "face" baked into the crust, seemingly begging you not to eat it. 🍑
*   **The Weeping Watermelon Wedges:** Juicy watermelon wedges that appear to "cry" watermelon juice when cut. 🍉
*   **The Existential Apple Juice:** Freshly squeezed apple juice that tastes strangely bitter, like the tears of a thousand apples. 🧃

## Theming

*   The stand is decorated with colorful, but unsettling, artwork depicting anthropomorphic fruits and vegetables.
*   The employees maintain a blank, emotionless demeanor, adding to the overall sense of unease.
*   The air is filled with the sounds of whimpering, sighing, and philosophical debate.
