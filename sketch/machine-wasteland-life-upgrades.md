A sterile, brightly lit store in The Machine Wasteland. Shelves are lined with identical, mass-produced products with generic branding. Drones with blank expressions shuffle through the aisles, aimlessly browsing the merchandise. A large screen displays the slogan: "Life Upgrades™️: Because You Deserve... Something."
