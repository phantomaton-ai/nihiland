A dilapidated and unsettling carousel in The Void Plaza. Instead of horses, the carousel features a collection of sad and broken figures: a tarnished trophy, a wilted flower, a rejected application, a divorce decree. The carousel moves slowly and mournfully, accompanied by a melancholic organ grinder tune.
