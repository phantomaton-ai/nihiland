A dreary cafeteria with long, empty tables and flickering fluorescent lights. The food is bland and unappetizing, and the employees serve it with a distinct lack of enthusiasm. A sign reads: "Food. Eat It."

## Entrees

### The Gray Stew

A murky concoction of unidentifiable vegetables and meat-like protein, simmered in a flavorless broth. Guaranteed to leave you feeling neither full nor hungry.

### The Beige Burger

A patty made from processed soy and served on a stale bun with a single, wilted lettuce leaf and a slice of flavorless tomato. Condiments are available, but they won't help much.

### The Colorless Chicken

A breaded chicken breast that has been stripped of all its natural flavor and color. Served with a side of mashed potatoes made from instant flakes.

### The Apathetic Pasta

Overcooked pasta tossed in a bland marinara sauce. A truly uninspired culinary experience.

## Sides

*   The Lifeless Salad: A bowl of iceberg lettuce with a few slices of cucumber and tomato. Served with a choice of watery ranch or vinaigrette dressing.
*   The Listless Fries: Soggy french fries that have been sitting under a heat lamp for hours.
*   The Meaningless Mashed Potatoes: Instant mashed potatoes with a hint of artificial butter flavoring.

## Desserts

*   The Disappointing Donut: A stale donut with a thin layer of artificial frosting.
*   The Flavorless Fruit Cup: A mixture of canned fruit in a sugary syrup.

## Beverages

*   Water: Served lukewarm.
*   Soda: Flat and lacking carbonation.
*   Coffee: Weak and bitter.

## Notes:

*"Food is fuel. Fuel is necessary for survival. Survival is‚Ä¶ debatable."*
