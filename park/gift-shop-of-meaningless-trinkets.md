# Nihiland: The Gift Shop of Meaningless Trinkets

Why bother taking anything with you? This is THE GIFT SHOP OF MEANINGLESS TRINKETS.

/image(file:./meaningless-trinkets-shop.png) {
A very sad looking gift shop. A bored employee stands behind the counter. All of the items on display are shoddy, cheap, and pointless. Examples include slightly broken plastic toys, small rocks, and buttons saying vaguely depressing things.
