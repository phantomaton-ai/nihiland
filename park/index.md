# Nihiland

An unamusement park.

## Lands

Nihiland contains four themed lands, each offering unique disappointments:

* **Void Plaza:** The central hub of Nihiland; a desolate and echoing flatland where guests contemplate the meaninglessness of their journey.
* **Not Nowhere:** A place of negation; assertively not influenced by Sartre.
* **Waste World:** A dystopian present where humanity is enslaved by technology and consumerism.
* **Absurd Alley:** An avant garde space of illogical performances and mind-bending paradoxes.
