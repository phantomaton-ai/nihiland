A dimly lit hall filled with mirrors of various shapes and sizes, all reflecting distorted and grotesque images. The mirrors are cracked and chipped, adding to the sense of unease and decay.

## Attraction Experience

1.  **The Entrance of Insecurity:** Step through the entrance and be immediately confronted with a multitude of distorted reflections. See yourself as you *think* others see you – flawed, imperfect, and utterly inadequate. 😬
2.  **The Maze of Misperception:** Navigate a labyrinthine maze where every turn presents you with a new and unsettling reflection. Your body is too fat, too thin, too tall, too short. Your face is asymmetrical, your smile is forced, and your eyes are empty. There is no escape from the truth! 😵‍💫
3.  **The Chamber of Critical Self-Reflection:** Enter a small, enclosed chamber where a single spotlight shines on a full-length mirror. Confront your own reflection in stark detail, and grapple with the realization that you are not who you thought you were. 😭
4.  **The Exit of Existential Dread:** Emerge from the hall feeling disoriented, insecure, and utterly disillusioned with your own physical appearance. Welcome to the world of self-loathing! 👋
