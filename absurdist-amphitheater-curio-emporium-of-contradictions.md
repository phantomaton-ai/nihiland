## Curious Merchandise

*   **The Self-Peeling Banana:** A banana that peels itself, but only when you're not looking at it. A frustrating exercise in delayed gratification. 🍌
*   **The Square Watermelon:** A watermelon that is perfectly square, but tastes exactly the same as a regular watermelon. A triumph of form over substance. 🍉
*   **The Inflatable Anvil:** An anvil that is made of inflatable rubber. A paradox of weight and weightlessness. 🪨🎈
*   **The Book of Blank Pages:** A book that is filled with nothing but blank pages. An invitation to create your own meaning...or not. 📖
*   **The Deconstructed Clock:** A clock that has been taken apart and reassembled in a completely random order. Time is meaningless, anyway! ⏰
*   **The Perpetual Calendar That's Always Wrong:** A calendar that is designed to display the correct date...but is always one day off. A constant reminder of the fallibility of systems. 📅
*   **The Framed Photograph of Nothing:** A picture frame that contains nothing but empty space. An ode to the void. 🖼️

## Theming

*   The store is designed to be cluttered, chaotic, and visually overwhelming.
*   The employees are unhelpful and may offer nonsensical advice.
*   The air is filled with the sounds of random noises, distorted music, and the quiet murmurs of confused shoppers.
