## What To Expect

First, you will pay for the hot dog, as that is not free. Then, a tired park employee will hand you a hot dog with whatever toppings they feel like using. Then, you will eat it. There are no other options.

## Hot Dog Options
While you don't pick the toppings, here are the things we COULD put on the hot dog:

*   Ketchup
*   Mustard
*   Relish
*   Onions
*   Chili
*   Cheese
*   Coleslaw

## WARNING
As there is no free will, you are not responsible for your actions. However, we ARE responsible, and we don't care, so there's that.
